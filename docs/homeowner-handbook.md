## REQUIRED: How to Take Great Photos & Videos

**Good photos = accurate estimates = fewer surprises.**

### Photo Best Practices

**DO:**
- Take photos in good lighting
- Capture the full area AND close-ups of the problem
- Include multiple angles
- Show any damage, stains, or visible issues
- Include a reference object for scale (like a coin or ruler)

**DON'T:**
- Take blurry or dark photos
- Only show part of the problem
- Use old photos from a different issue

### What to Photograph

| Issue Type | What to Capture |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Leak | Source of water, water damage, wet areas, under sinks |
| HVAC issue | Thermostat display, unit exterior, filter condition, error codes |
| Electrical | Outlet/switch, breaker panel, any burn marks or damage |
| Appliance | Model number sticker, the malfunction, error codes displayed |
| Exterior | Wide shot of area, close-up of damage, affected materials |

### Video Tips

For complex issues, a 10-30 second video can be invaluable:
- Show the problem in action (strange noise, intermittent issue)
- Narrate what you're showing
- Keep the camera steady
- Good lighting is essential

**To upload:**
1. Click **"Add Photos/Video"** on the request form
2. Select files from your device OR take a new photo
3. Wait for upload to complete (you'll see a checkmark)
4. Add more if needed (we recommend 3-5 photos minimum)

---

## How to Describe the Issue Clearly

The better your description, the more accurate your estimate.

### Good Description Formula

**[What] + [Where] + [When it started] + [What you've tried]**

### Examples

**Poor:** "AC broken"

**Good:** "Air conditioner is blowing warm air. Started 2 days ago. Thermostat is set to 72°F but house is 80°F. I checked the filter and it's clean. Unit outside is running but making a clicking sound."

**Poor:** "Leak in bathroom"

**Good:** "Water is dripping from under the bathroom sink. Noticed a puddle this morning. Leak seems to be coming from the P-trap connection. It's a slow drip, about one drop every 5 seconds."

---

## Emergency vs. Routine Requests

### Mark as EMERGENCY if:
- Active water flooding
- Gas smell
- No heat in freezing weather
- No AC in extreme heat with vulnerable household members
- Electrical sparking or burning smell
- Sewage backup
- Security issue (broken lock, broken window)

**Emergency requests are prioritized and may incur after-hours fees.**

### Mark as ROUTINE if:
- Issue is inconvenient but not dangerous
- Can wait a few days for scheduling
- Preventive maintenance
- Minor repairs
- Cosmetic issues

# FAQ

## Getting Started

**Q1: Is RegularUpkeep really free for 1-2 homes?**
A: Yes! You can manage up to 2 properties completely free. You only pay for services when you book a provider, plus small platform fees on bookings.

**Q2: Do I need to download an app?**
A: RegularUpkeep works in any web browser at app.regularupkeep.com. A mobile app may also be available [TBD — confirm availability] for convenient access.

**Q3: What areas do you serve?**
A: We currently serve Eastern North Carolina and are growing. Enter your address during signup to confirm availability in your area.

**Q4: Can I use RegularUpkeep for a rental property I own?**
A: Absolutely! You can add rental properties and even give tenants limited access to submit maintenance requests ($2.50/month per tenant seat).

**Q5: How long does setup take?**
A: Basic setup takes about 10 minutes. Adding all your systems and documents might take 30-60 minutes, but you can do this over time.

## Properties & Systems

**Q6: What if I sell one of my homes?**
A: Go to **Properties** → select the property → **Settings** → **Remove Property**. You can export your maintenance history first for the new owner.

**Q7: Can I transfer my home data to the new owner?**
A: Yes, you can generate a Home History Report and share it with the buyer. [TBD — confirm if direct transfer feature exists]

**Q8: Do I have to add all my systems at once?**
A: No, add them as you have time. But the more systems you track, the better your maintenance reminders will be.

**Q9: What if I don't know my system details (brand, age, etc.)?**
A: Add what you know — you can always update later. Check appliance labels, look up purchase records, or ask a service provider during their next visit.

**Q10: How do I find my HVAC model number?**
A: Check the metal plate on your indoor unit (usually in a closet or utility room) or outdoor unit. It will have manufacturer name, model, and serial number.

## Service Requests

**Q11: How quickly will I get a response to my request?**
A: Most requests receive provider responses within 24 hours. Emergency requests are prioritized.

**Q12: Can I choose my own provider?**
A: Yes, if you have a preferred provider, you can request them specifically. They must be registered on our platform [TBD — confirm if users can invite providers].

**Q13: What if I'm not happy with the estimates I receive?**
A: You're never obligated to accept. You can decline all estimates and either wait for more options or handle it yourself.

**Q14: Do I have to be home for the service?**
A: It depends on the work. Many homeowners provide access instructions (lockbox, garage code) for routine work. For major repairs, we recommend being present.

**Q15: What if additional work is needed beyond the estimate?**
A: Providers must submit a "change order" if the cost will exceed the estimate by more than the approved buffer (typically 12% or $75). You'll approve any additional costs before work continues.

## Payments & Fees

**Q16: Why is there a diagnostic fee?**
A: The diagnostic fee ensures providers are compensated for their time and expertise in assessing your issue. It's credited toward your final bill if you proceed with the work.

**Q17: When am I charged for a service?**
A: The diagnostic fee is charged when you book. The remaining balance is charged when the work is completed and you approve the invoice.

**Q18: What payment methods are accepted?**
A: We accept major credit cards and debit cards. [TBD — confirm if other methods like ACH are available]

**Q19: Is my payment information secure?**
A: Yes, we use industry-standard encryption and never store your full card number on our servers.

**Q20: What if I have a billing dispute?**
A: You have 72 hours after payment to file a dispute. Go to the booking → **"Report Issue"** → **"Billing Dispute"**. Our team will investigate.

## Quality & Trust

**Q21: How do you vet providers?**
A: Providers must meet our requirements for licensing (where applicable), insurance, and pass a background check. We also monitor customer ratings and reviews.

**Q22: What if I'm not satisfied with the work?**
A: First, message the provider through the app to discuss the issue. If unresolved, file a dispute within 72 hours. Our team will review and mediate.

**Q23: Can I leave an anonymous review?**
A: Reviews include your first name and last initial. You cannot leave fully anonymous reviews, but providers cannot see your contact information.

**Q24: What happens if something is damaged during service?**
A: All providers on our platform carry insurance. Document the damage with photos and file a report immediately through the booking.

**Q25: How do I report a safety concern?**
A: If you feel unsafe, leave the situation and call 911 if necessary. Then report to us immediately via **Help** → **Report Safety Concern** or call 888-502-UPKEEP.

## Features & Tools

**Q26: How does the AI photo analysis work?**
A: When you upload photos of an issue, our AI analyzes them to help identify the problem, suggest the right service category, assess urgency, and flag any safety concerns.

**Q27: Can I turn off AI features?**
A: Yes, go to **Profile** → **Privacy Settings** → toggle off AI features. Note that this may reduce the accuracy of recommendations.

**Q28: Is the maintenance calendar customizable?**
A: Yes, you can add your own tasks, adjust frequencies, and snooze or dismiss recommendations that don't apply to your home.

**Q29: Can I print my maintenance calendar?**
