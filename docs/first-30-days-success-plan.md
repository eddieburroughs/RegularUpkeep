## Troubleshooting & FAQ

### 1. I can't find my address during property setup
**Solution**: Try entering just the street address first. If not found, use "Enter manually" option. New construction may not be in databases yet.

### 2. I don't know my system details (model, install date)
**Solution**: Check the unit itself for labels, or upload a photo — we can help identify. Partial info is fine; update later when you find documentation.

### 3. My verification email never arrived
**Solution**: Check spam/junk folder. Add noreply@regularupkeep.com to contacts. Use "Resend verification" on the login page.

### 4. I uploaded a document but can't find it
**Solution**: Go to Home Binder → select your property → documents are organized by type. Use the search function if you have many.

### 5. No providers are available in my area
**Solution**: Join the waitlist — you'll be notified when coverage expands. Try broader service categories (e.g., "General Handyman" vs. specific trade).

### 6. The estimate seems too high
**Solution**: Estimates vary by provider. You can decline and request from another provider, or message to discuss scope. Diagnostic fees are always credited.

### 7. I need to reschedule my appointment
**Solution**: Go to Requests → your booking → Reschedule. Free if 24+ hours ahead; $15 fee for same-day changes.

### 8. The provider didn't show up
**Solution**: Report immediately in the app. You'll get a full refund plus $10 credit. We take no-shows seriously.

### 9. I'm not getting notifications
**Solution**: Check Settings → Notifications. Ensure SMS and push are enabled. Check phone's app notification settings too.

### 10. How do I add a second property?
**Solution**: Properties → + Add Property. Your first 2 properties are free; additional homes are $2.50/month each.

### 11. Can my spouse/partner access our home?
**Solution**: Go to Properties → your property → Members → Invite. They'll get full access to that property's information.

### 12. What's the difference between diagnostic fee and final cost?
**Solution**: Diagnostic fee is paid upfront for the provider visit. It's credited toward your final invoice — you're not paying twice.

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

### 1. Can I import properties from a spreadsheet?

### 2. How do I organize properties by region or type?
**Solution**: Use naming conventions (e.g., "NC-Raleigh-123 Main"). Properties can be filtered by search.

### 3. Team member can see all my properties — how do I limit?
**Solution**: Access is per-property. Go to each property → Members → set role. Remove from properties they shouldn't access.

### 4. How do I handle tenant-reported issues?
**Solution**: Invite tenants as "Tenant" role — they can report issues but not see financials. Or forward requests on their behalf.

### 5. Can I have preferred providers across my portfolio?
**Solution**: Rate providers highly and message them for repeat work. [TBD — preferred provider list feature may be available.]

### 6. How do I track spending across properties?
**Solution**: Billing → Transaction History shows all charges. Export for accounting reconciliation.

### 7. What happens if a property sells?
**Solution**: Properties → select property → Settings → Archive/Delete. Documents can be exported first.

### 8. Can I add commercial properties?
**Solution**: Yes, select "Commercial" as property type. Service availability may vary for commercial.

### 9. How do I handle emergency maintenance at night?
**Solution**: Submit urgent request — after-hours providers are available with 35% surcharge.

### 10. My property manager left — how do I transfer access?
**Solution**: Properties → property → Members → remove old manager, invite new one. Revoke immediately when employment ends.

### 11. Can I see maintenance history before I bought the property?
**Solution**: Only if previous owner shared via platform. Start fresh; ask seller for service records.

### 12. Is there a discount for large portfolios?
**Solution**: Contact sales@regularupkeep.com for enterprise/portfolio pricing discussions.

---

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

### 1. I'm not receiving any job offers
**Solution**: Check your service area coverage, categories are correct, and notifications are enabled. Ensure profile is 100% complete.

### 2. My insurance certificate was rejected
**Solution**: Ensure it's current (not expired), shows your business name, and is a PDF/image. Contact support if issues persist.

### 3. The homeowner isn't responding to messages
**Solution**: Try both in-app message and call (via app). If no response within 4 hours of appointment, contact support.

### 4. How do I submit a change order?
**Solution**: On active job → Submit Change Order → Enter new total with reason and photos. Wait for homeowner approval before proceeding.

### 5. When do I get paid?
**Solution**: 72 hours after job completion (dispute window). With Instant Payout add-on (+1%), you can get paid immediately.

### 6. A homeowner left an unfair review
**Solution**: Respond professionally (once). If review violates policy (harassment, false claims), report it via the flag icon.

### 7. Can I add team members?
**Solution**: Go to Team → Add Member → assign role (Owner, Manager, Technician). Technicians can see jobs but not financials.

### 8. How do I become a Preferred provider?
**Solution**: Maintain 4.5+ rating, complete 10+ jobs, <5% dispute rate. Status is reviewed automatically.

### 9. What's the platform fee?
**Solution**: 8% commission on job subtotal ($3.50 minimum). Excludes tax, tips, and permit fees.

### 10. I need to cancel an accepted job
**Solution**: Cancel early if possible (24+ hours = no penalty). Last-minute cancellations affect your rating and may result in suspension.

### 11. The homeowner wasn't home — what do I do?
**Solution**: Wait 15 minutes, call/message, take timestamped photo, mark as no-show in app. You'll receive the diagnostic fee + trip compensation.

### 12. How do I expand my service area?
**Solution**: Profile → Service Area → add ZIP codes. Start small and expand as you build capacity.

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

### 1. I'm not receiving job notifications
**Solution**: Check you're marked "Online," notifications are enabled, and your service area/skills match available jobs.

### 2. The job is outside my skill set
**Solution**: Decline honestly. Better to decline than do poor work. Your reputation matters.

### 3. I arrived but homeowner isn't home
**Solution**: Wait 15 minutes, call/message, take photo, report no-show. You'll receive trip compensation.

### 4. The job needs more work than described
**Solution**: Contact the provider company before doing extra work. They handle change orders with homeowners.

### 5. When do I get paid?
**Solution**: Payouts process after the provider receives payment (typically 72 hours after job completion).

### 6. I need to cancel a job I accepted
**Solution**: Cancel as early as possible. Same-day cancellations may affect your rating.

### 7. The homeowner is asking for additional work on-site
**Solution**: For small additions, use your judgment. For significant additions, contact the provider company first.

### 8. How do I see my earnings?
**Solution**: Money tab shows pending, processing, and completed payouts.

### 9. I got a bad review — can I respond?
**Solution**: You cannot respond directly to homeowner reviews, but the provider company may address it with the homeowner.

### 10. Can I work for multiple provider companies?
**Solution**: Yes, you can work with multiple providers on the platform. Manage your availability accordingly.

### 11. What if I'm running late to a job?
**Solution**: Message immediately through the app. Communicate ETA. Consistent lateness affects your rating.

3. **Document every major decision** — Consistency requires records
4. **Train a backup admin by Day 14** — You will need vacation eventually

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

### 1. I need to change a platform-wide setting (pricing, fees)
**Solution**: Admin → Config. Changes take effect immediately for new transactions. Be certain before changing.

### 2. A customer is demanding to speak with a manager
**Solution**: Review their account and history first. If warranted, you can call directly or schedule a call.

### 3. A provider claims they didn't receive a dispute notification
**Solution**: Check the notification logs. If sent, it's their responsibility. Provide the information again via direct message.

### 4. How do I process a refund?
**Solution**: Find the booking → Actions → Refund. Select amount and reason. Approval may be required for large amounts.

### 5. A provider is disputing their suspension
**Solution**: Review the enforcement record. Provide specific incidents. If valid appeal, you can lift or reduce suspension.

### 6. How do I verify a provider's insurance?
**Solution**: Check uploaded document for: current dates, matching business name, adequate coverage. Contact issuer if suspicious.

### 7. There's a system error affecting multiple users
**Solution**: Check server status, PM2 logs, and recent deployments. Escalate to engineering if not an obvious fix.

### 8. How do I handle a safety complaint (assault, threats)?
**Solution**: Immediately suspend the accused party. Document everything. Involve legal/law enforcement if appropriate.

### 9. Revenue isn't matching expectations
**Solution**: Review booking volume, average job size, and fee collection. Check for failed payments or unusual refund rates.

### 10. A user wants their data deleted
**Solution**: Data deletion requests require identity verification. Follow the data deletion SOP and comply with privacy regulations.

### 11. How do I add a new admin?
**Solution**: Admin → Users → Find user or create → Set role to Admin. Grant only necessary permissions.

### 12. Cron jobs aren't running
**Solution**: Check server cron configuration and logs. Verify CRON_SECRET is correct. Restart if needed.

Train a backup admin — you'll need coverage eventually. Consistent enforcement maintains platform quality."

Document all standard operating procedures in an internal wiki. Set up scheduled metric exports for regular review. Review and update admin team access. Plan for scaling — more volume means more admins or more automation. By Day 30, your platform should run smoothly with clear visibility into all operations."

When you request service, you pay a diagnostic fee upfront (amount varies by service type, e.g., $79 for plumbing, $89 for HVAC). This fee covers the provider's trip and initial assessment. Here's the key: this fee is CREDITED toward your final invoice. You're not paying twice. If your final bill is $300 and you paid $79 diagnostic, you only owe $221 more. The diagnostic fee is refundable if cancelled 24+ hours before, but non-refundable if cancelled last-minute or if you're not home."

After service, keep photos of completed work. For providers/handymen: take before photos when you arrive (BEFORE touching anything) and after photos when done. These protect you if there's ever a dispute. 'I didn't cause that damage — here's my before photo.' For everyone: in disputes, the party with better documentation usually prevails. It takes 30 seconds to take photos but can save hours of argument later."

Target under 2 hours for job offer responses, ideally under 30 minutes. For customer messages, respond within 4 hours. Why? Homeowners are anxious about their home issues. Fast responses show you're reliable and professional. Slow responses make them move to another provider. Enable all notification types (push, SMS, email) so you never miss a job. If you can't respond quickly, set yourself offline rather than missing opportunities."

Here's how it works: The provider discovers additional work is needed. They submit a change order with the new total, reason, and photos. The homeowner receives a notification and has 4 hours to respond. They can approve (work continues), decline (only original scope), or negotiate. If no response, only original work is completed.

      "content": "No-shows hurt everyone, so here's how they're handled. If the homeowner isn't home: Provider waits 15 minutes, attempts contact, takes a timestamped arrival photo, then marks no-show. Homeowner is charged the diagnostic fee plus $25 trip fee. If the provider doesn't show: Homeowner reports it immediately. They get a full refund plus $10 credit. Provider receives a serious strike on their record. For homeowners: ensure someone 18+ is home during the appointment window. For providers: if you can't make it, cancel as early as possible — last-minute cancellations damage your rating."
