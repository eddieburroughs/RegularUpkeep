# 1. Homeowner Guide: How to Capture the Issue

Good photos help providers understand your problem, give accurate quotes, and complete work faster. Poor photos lead to misquotes, wasted trips, and disputes.

## The 4-Photo Rule

For every issue, capture these four shots:

| Shot | Purpose | Distance |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Context Shot** | Shows where the issue is located in the room/area | 6-10 feet back |
| **Medium Shot** | Shows the affected area clearly | 3-4 feet |
| **Close-Up** | Shows the specific problem in detail | 1-2 feet |
| **Reference Shot** | Shows model/serial numbers, measurements, or labels | As close as readable |

## Lighting Guidelines

### Do's
- Use natural daylight when possible (open blinds/curtains)
- Turn on all room lights
- Use your phone's flashlight for dark spaces (cabinets, attics, crawlspaces)
- Position yourself so light shines ON the problem, not behind it

### Don'ts
- Don't shoot directly into windows or lights (creates silhouettes)
- Don't use flash on reflective surfaces (mirrors, chrome, water)
- Don't take photos in complete darkness without a light source

### Lighting Quick Fixes

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Too dark | Add a lamp or flashlight nearby |
| Too bright/washed out | Turn off overhead light, use side lighting |
| Glare on surface | Change your angle, turn off flash |
| Shadows hiding detail | Add light from opposite direction |

## Distance & Angles

### For Wall/Ceiling Issues
- Stand perpendicular to the surface
- Include at least 2 feet of surrounding area for context
- For cracks: shoot along the crack AND perpendicular to it

### For Floor Issues
- Shoot from standing height looking down (context)
- Kneel for medium shot
- Get low/close for detail shots

### For Appliances & Equipment
- Full front view (context)
- Problem area (medium)
- Model/serial label (close-up)
- Control panel or error codes if applicable

### For Outdoor Issues
- Wide shot showing property context
- Medium shot of affected area
- Close-up of damage/problem
- Include reference objects for scale (ruler, coin, hand)

## Including Measurements

When to include measurements:
- Holes, cracks, or damage (show length/width)
- Spaces where something will be installed
- Areas with water damage (show extent)
- Any issue where size affects pricing

### How to Show Scale

| Method | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| Tape measure in frame | Cracks, holes, dimensions |
| Ruler next to damage | Small defects, gaps |
| Credit card for scale | Small damage, insect size |
| Hand in frame | Quick reference |
| Standard object | Door, window, furniture nearby |

## Model & Serial Number Tags

**Always photograph these for:**
- HVAC systems (furnace, AC, heat pump)
- Water heaters
- Appliances needing repair
- Garage door openers
- Pool/spa equipment

**Where to find them:**
| Equipment | Label Location |
|-----------|----------------|
| Furnace | Inside access panel, front or side |
| AC unit | Side panel, near electrical connection |
| Water heater | Front label or side panel |
| Refrigerator | Inside door jamb or back panel |
| Washer/Dryer | Inside door or back panel |
| Dishwasher | Inside door edge or side panel |

**Photo tips for labels:**
- Fill the frame with the label
- Ensure all text is readable (not blurry)
- If label is damaged, photograph what's visible
- Note: We can often look up parts from model numbers

## Safety Warnings

### STOP and Call 911 First If You See:

| Hazard | Signs | Do NOT Photograph |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| **Gas Leak** | Rotten egg smell, hissing sound | Leave immediately, call from outside |
| **Electrical Fire** | Smoke, burning smell, sparks | Evacuate, don't touch anything |
| **Structural Collapse** | Sagging ceiling, cracking walls | Leave the area |
| **Flooding with Power** | Standing water near outlets | Do not enter water |

### Photograph Safely:

| Situation | Safety Precaution |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Electrical issues | Do NOT touch; photograph from distance |
| Water leaks | Turn off water main first if active |
| Roof/heights | Do NOT climb; photograph from ground |
| Mold | Do not disturb; photograph as-is |
| Pest infestation | Do not handle; photograph from distance |

### When Photographing Hazards:
1. Stay at safe distance
2. Do not touch or move anything
3. Note the hazard in your description
4. Mark request as "Urgent" if active danger

## Video Guidelines

### When Video is Better Than Photos:
- Intermittent issues (noise that comes and goes)
- Water leaks (shows flow rate)
- HVAC issues (shows airflow, sounds)
- Mechanical failures (shows movement/lack thereof)
- Electrical issues (shows flickering, sparking)

### Video Requirements:
- **Duration:** 10-30 seconds
- **Orientation:** Horizontal (landscape) preferred
- **Stability:** Hold phone steady, use both hands
- **Audio:** Include sound if relevant (describe while filming)
- **Lighting:** Same rules as photos

### What to Show in Video:
1. Start wide (context)
2. Slowly zoom/move to the problem
3. Hold on problem area for 5+ seconds
4. Narrate: "This is [location]. You can see [problem]. It started [when]."

**Must Be Visible:**
- Date/time (embedded in metadata - automatic)
- The problem as described by customer
- Surrounding area condition
- Any pre-existing damage (document this!)

### DURING Photos (Minimum 1)

**Purpose:** Show work in progress and methodology

| Shot | What to Include | Why |
|------|-----------------|-----|
| Work in Progress | Active repair/installation | Proves work was actually performed |
| Discoveries | Anything found during work | Justifies change orders |

**Must Be Visible:**
- Materials being used
- Work methodology
- Any surprises/discoveries
- Access areas opened

### AFTER Photos (Minimum 2)

**Purpose:** Prove completion and quality

| Shot | What to Include | Why |
|------|-----------------|-----|
| Completed Work | Same angle as "before" shot | Direct comparison |
| Detail | Close-up of finished work | Shows quality and craftsmanship |

**Must Be Visible:**
- Completed repair/installation
- Cleanup done
- Same area as "before" photos
- Any test results (water running, power on, etc.)

## Photo Labeling System

Use descriptive filenames or add notes in the app:

### Naming Convention
```
[STAGE]_[LOCATION]_[DESCRIPTION]
```

### Examples:
- `BEFORE_kitchen_sink_leak`
- `DURING_pipe_replacement`
- `AFTER_sink_repaired_tested`
- `DISCOVERY_rotted_subfloor`

### In-App Notes (Required for):
- Any pre-existing damage
- Discoveries during work
- Deviations from estimate
- Customer-caused issues
- Areas you did NOT work on

## Protective Documentation

### Document These to Protect Yourself:

| Situation | What to Photograph | Notes to Add |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| Pre-existing damage | Damage with scale reference | "Pre-existing damage observed on arrival" |
| Customer decisions | Any declined recommendations | "Customer declined [recommendation]" |
| Out of scope areas | Areas near but not part of work | "Adjacent area not part of scope" |
| Difficult access | Obstacles, clutter, conditions | "Access limited by [reason]" |
| Safety concerns | Hazards you're documenting | "Safety concern noted and reported" |

### Verbal Agreements
If customer verbally agrees to anything, document it:
1. Photo of area discussed
2. Note describing agreement
3. Time stamp of conversation
4. Follow up with in-app message confirmation

**Title:** Toilet running constantly, won't stop

**Description:**
"The toilet in our master bathroom has been running constantly for 3 days. You can hear water continuously flowing into the bowl.

The toilet is about 8 years old - it's a Kohler. Water bill will probably be high this month."

**What tried:** Jiggled handle, adjusted float

### Photos Submitted (4)

1. **Context shot:** Full bathroom showing toilet location
