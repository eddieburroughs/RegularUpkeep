## 2. What RegularUpkeep Does for Portfolio Owners

### The Multi-Property Challenge

Managing 3+ properties means:
- Tracking different systems with different ages and service histories
- Coordinating multiple vendors across locations
- Maintaining documentation for insurance, taxes, and resale
- Preventing small issues from becoming expensive emergencies
- Scaling your time efficiently

### How RegularUpkeep Solves This

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| "Which property needs the HVAC filter changed?" | Unified maintenance calendar with property-specific tasks |
| "Who serviced the water heater at 456 Oak?" | Complete service history per property |
| "I need all inspection reports for my insurance" | Document binder with PDF export |
| "Different properties need different providers" | Provider network organized by service area |
| "My property manager needs access" | Role-based sharing (owner, manager, tenant, viewer) |
| "What should I budget for maintenance?" | AI Maintenance Coach with cost estimates |

---

## 3. Core Concepts

### Properties

Each property in your portfolio is a separate entity with:
- **Address & Details**: Location, type, square footage, year built
- **Systems**: HVAC, plumbing, electrical, appliances tracked individually
- **Members**: Who has access (you, managers, tenants)
- **Documents**: Warranties, manuals, receipts, inspection reports
- **Service History**: All maintenance and repairs logged

### Property Types Supported

| Type | Description | Common Use |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Single Family | Detached home | Primary residence, rental |
| Condo | Unit in shared building | Investment property |
| Townhouse | Attached multi-story | Rental, personal |
| Apartment | Unit in apartment complex | Rental |
| Multi-Family | Duplex, triplex, fourplex | Investment property |
| Commercial | Office, retail, warehouse | Business property |

### Systems Tracking

Each property can track:
- **HVAC**: Furnace, AC, heat pump, mini-splits
- **Plumbing**: Water heater, sump pump, water softener
- **Electrical**: Panel, generator, solar
- **Appliances**: Washer, dryer, refrigerator, dishwasher
- **Exterior**: Roof, siding, gutters, deck
- **Safety**: Smoke detectors, CO detectors, security system

For each system, you can record:
- Brand and model
- Installation/purchase date
- Age
- Last service date
- Condition (excellent, good, fair, poor)

## 4. Multi-Property Setup Playbook

### 4.1 Property Naming Convention

**Establish a consistent naming system before adding properties.**

| Approach | Example | Best For |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Address-based | "123 Main St" | Small portfolios (<10) |
| Nickname + Type | "Oak Ave Duplex" | Mixed-use portfolios |
| Code + Location | "R01-Downtown" | Large portfolios (10+) |
| Tenant-based | "Smith Rental" | Tenant-focused management |

**Recommendation for 3-10 properties:**
```
[Street Name] [Property Type]
Examples:
- Main St SFH
- Oak Ave Duplex
- Pine Rd Rental
- Cedar Ln Condo
```

### 4.2 Property Baseline Checklist

**Complete this for EVERY property before active management:**

#### Basic Information
- [ ] Full address entered correctly
- [ ] Property type selected
- [ ] Year built recorded
- [ ] Square footage entered
- [ ] Bedroom/bathroom count
- [ ] Nickname assigned (per your convention)

#### Systems Inventory
- [ ] HVAC system(s) documented with age
- [ ] Water heater documented with age
- [ ] Electrical panel capacity noted
- [ ] Roof age and material recorded
- [ ] Major appliances listed (if included)
- [ ] Safety devices verified (smoke/CO detectors)

#### Documentation Upload
- [ ] Insurance declaration page
- [ ] Most recent inspection report (if available)
- [ ] Warranties for major systems
- [ ] Appliance manuals (or links)
- [ ] Lease agreement (for rentals)

#### Access Information
- [ ] Property access method noted (lockbox code, key location)
- [ ] Utility shutoff locations documented
- [ ] Emergency contacts listed
- [ ] Pet/security system notes added

### 4.3 Standardized Notes Template

Use consistent notes across properties:

```
ACCESS: [Lockbox 1234 on back door / Key under mat / Contact tenant 24hrs ahead]
UTILITIES: Gas shutoff [location], Water main [location], Electrical panel [location]
PETS: [None / Dog (friendly) / Cat (indoor)]
ALARM: [None / Code: 1234# / Disarm before entry]
PARKING: [Driveway / Street / Tenant reserves spot]
SPECIAL: [Any property-specific notes]
```

### 4.4 Bulk Property Entry Strategy

**If adding 5+ properties:**

1. **Prepare a spreadsheet first** with all property data
2. **Add properties in geographic clusters** (makes provider assignment easier)
3. **Complete one property fully** before moving to the next
4. **Set aside 15-20 minutes per property** for thorough setup
5. **Add systems immediately** while you have records handy

## 5. Portfolio Maintenance Strategy

### 5.1 Seasonal Calendar Across Properties

**RegularUpkeep generates property-specific recommendations, but here's how to think portfolio-wide:**

#### Q1 (January - March)
| Task | Frequency | Properties Affected |
|------|-----------|---------------------|
| Replace HVAC filters | Monthly | All with forced air |
| Test smoke/CO detectors | Once | All |

## 6. Work Order Quality Standards

### 6.1 Mandatory Photo/Video Checklist

**For every service request, capture:**

#### Before Service
- [ ] **Wide shot** of affected area (shows context)
- [ ] **Close-up** of the specific issue
- [ ] **Video** (10-30 seconds) if issue involves sound, movement, or water

#### After Service (Provider Should Provide)
- [ ] **Completion photo** showing resolved issue
- [ ] **Photo of any parts replaced** (for records)
- [ ] **Photo of any new equipment installed** (for warranty)

### 6.2 Required Fields for Every Request

**Always include in your service request:**

| Field | Why It Matters | Example |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| **Property** | Ensures correct location | "456 Oak Ave Duplex" |
| **Category** | Routes to right provider | "Plumbing" |
| **Location in Property** | Saves provider time | "Master bathroom, 2nd floor" |
| **Issue Description** | Clear problem statement | "Faucet drips continuously" |
| **Urgency** | Sets expectations | "Not urgent - can wait a week" |
| **Access Instructions** | Prevents delays | "Lockbox 4532 on back door" |
| **Tenant Notification** | Coordination | "Tenant aware, prefers mornings" |
| **Budget/Approval Notes** | Avoids surprises | "Approve up to $300 without calling" |

### 6.3 Service Request Template

Use this format for consistent, high-quality requests:

```
PROPERTY: [Property nickname]
CATEGORY: [HVAC/Plumbing/Electrical/etc.]
LOCATION: [Room and floor]

ISSUE: [One-sentence description]

DETAILS:
- When it started: [Date/timeframe]
- Frequency: [Constant / Intermittent / Triggered by X]

## 7. Vendor/Provider Network Management

### 7.1 Preferred Providers Concept

Build a reliable vendor network for your portfolio:

| Tier | Definition | How to Use |
|------|------------|------------|
| **Preferred** | Proven performers you request by name | Request specifically in service notes |
| **Approved** | Acceptable quality, use when preferred unavailable | Default for category |
| **Trial** | New providers being evaluated | Monitor closely |
| **Do Not Use** | Poor experience | Note in property access instructions |

### 7.2 Provider Scorecard

**Track these metrics for each provider you use:**

| Metric | How to Measure | Target |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| **Quality** | Work done right first time? | 90%+ |
| **Speed** | Days from request to completion | Category-dependent |
| **Communication** | Responsive to messages? | Same-day replies |
| **Pricing** | Fair for market? | Within 15% of quotes |
| **Professionalism** | Clean site, on time, polite? | Always |

#### Sample Scorecard Template

```
Provider: ABC Plumbing
Category: Plumbing
Jobs Completed: 8
Average Rating: 4.5/5

QUALITY: 9/10 (one callback for small leak)
SPEED: 8/10 (usually within 2-3 days)
COMMUNICATION: 10/10 (responds within hours)
PRICING: 8/10 (slightly above average, but worth it)
PROFESSIONALISM: 10/10 (always on time, cleans up)

OVERALL: PREFERRED
Notes: Best for water heater work. Request specifically.
```

### 7.3 Building Your Network

**Strategies for multi-property owners:**

1. **Start with RegularUpkeep's vetted network** - Verified providers have background checks and insurance
2. **Request the same provider** for repeat work at a property
3. **Ask providers about multi-property discounts** - Some offer portfolio pricing
4. **Note provider strengths** - Some are better at certain work types
5. **Maintain backup providers** - Don't be dependent on one vendor per category

## 18. FAQ (Multi-Property Focus)

### Setup & Organization

**Q1: How many properties can I add to one account?**
A: No limit. Your first 2 are free, then $2.50/month for each additional property.

**Q2: Can I organize properties into groups or folders?**
A: Not currently. Use a consistent naming convention (e.g., "Rental-OakSt" vs "Personal-MainSt") to organize visually. [TBD — folders may be added]

**Q3: How do I copy system information from one property to another?**
A: Currently, you need to enter systems individually. For identical properties (same model homes), document one thoroughly and use as reference. [TBD — template feature may be added]

**Q4: Can I bulk-import properties from a spreadsheet?**
A: Not currently. Add properties individually through the interface. [TBD — bulk import may be added]

**Q5: What's the best way to name my properties?**
A: Use a consistent format like "[Street] [Type]" (e.g., "Main St SFH", "Oak Ave Duplex"). This makes filtering and identification easy.

**Q6: Should I add properties I'm about to sell?**
A: Yes—get inspection reports and documentation ready. You can archive after sale but keep records.

### Maintenance Across Properties

**Q7: Can I schedule the same maintenance task across all properties at once?**
A: Not currently. Schedule per property, but you can request the same provider for efficiency. [TBD — bulk scheduling may be added]

**Q8: How do I see what maintenance is due across all properties?**
A: The Maintenance Calendar shows tasks from all properties color-coded or filterable by property.

**Q9: Does the AI Maintenance Coach work for all my properties?**
A: Yes, each property gets its own AI-generated recommendations based on its specific systems, age, and location.

**Q10: How do I prioritize which property needs attention first?**
A: Check for "urgent" or "now" tasks in recommendations. Older systems and properties with deferred maintenance typically need priority.

**Q11: Can I create my own maintenance templates?**
A: Not currently. Use the AI recommendations as a starting point and note your standards in property notes. [TBD — custom templates may be added]

### Providers & Vendors

**Q12: Will providers service all my properties if they're in different areas?**
A: Providers set their service areas. You may have different preferred providers for different property locations.

**Q13: How do I request a specific provider I've used before?**
A: In your service request, add a note: "Please assign [Provider Name] if available."

**Q14: Can I see provider ratings before selecting them?**
A: RegularUpkeep matches you with vetted, verified providers. You can see ratings after they complete work for you.

**Q15: Do providers offer multi-property discounts?**
A: Some may. Ask in messaging. "Do you offer discounts for servicing multiple properties in my portfolio?"

**Q16: How do I track provider performance across my portfolio?**
A: Review completed jobs and ratings. Keep notes in a separate scorecard (RegularUpkeep tracks job history, not custom scorecards). [TBD — provider scorecard feature may be added]

### Access & Delegation

**Q17: Can my property manager submit service requests on my behalf?**
A: Yes, with "Manager" role they can submit requests, view history, and communicate with providers.

**Q18: Can I give someone access to only some of my properties?**
A: Yes. Add them as a member only to specific properties, not all.

**Q19: Can tenants submit service requests directly?**
A: Yes, with "Tenant" role. Requests still go through you for approval before provider dispatch.

**Q20: How do I revoke someone's access?**
A: Properties → [Property] → Members → Remove member.

**Q21: Can I have multiple owners on a property?**
A: Yes, you can add another user with "Owner" role.

### Billing & Costs

**Q22: Is there a volume discount for many properties?**
A: The pricing is already low ($2.50/home/month beyond 2 free). Contact support for enterprise portfolio pricing (20+ properties).

**Q23: How are service costs charged?**
A: Per job—diagnostic fee when dispatched, service invoice when work completed. You pay per job, not per property.

**Q24: Can I get a single invoice for all my properties for accounting?**
A: Individual invoices per job are generated. [TBD — consolidated billing statements may be available]

**Q25: Are maintenance costs tax deductible?**
A: For rental/investment properties, typically yes. Consult your tax advisor. Download invoices from your transaction history.

### Reports & Documentation

**Q26: Can I export maintenance history for a property sale?**
A: Inspection reports export as PDF. Full service history export [TBD — confirm in product].

**Q27: What documentation should I keep for insurance?**
A: Inspection reports, proof of maintenance (service invoices), system information. All available in binder and transaction history.

**Q28: Can I generate a report showing spending by property?**
A: [TBD — spending reports may be added. Currently track via transaction history.]

**Q29: How long is my data retained?**
A: Service history and documents are retained as long as your account is active. Archived properties retain their history.

**Q30: Can I export all my data if I leave the platform?**
A: Contact support for a data export request.
