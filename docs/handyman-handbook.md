```

#### Step 4: Before Photos

### Navigation Shortcuts

**From Job Card:**

---

## 5. Photo/Video Standards

### Why Documentation Matters

- **Protects you** from false damage claims
- **Shows quality** of your work
- **Helps customers** see what was done
- **Builds trust** with the platform
- **Supports payment** approval

### Required Photos

#### BEFORE Photos

| Shot | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Wide shot | Shows context | Full room with problem area visible |
| Close-up | Shows specific issue | Broken hinge, leak, damage |
| Existing damage | Protects you | Scratches, stains already there |
| Labels/serial numbers | Identifies equipment | Model info for parts |

#### AFTER Photos

| Shot | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Wide shot | Shows completed area | Same angle as before |
| Close-up | Shows repair/work done | Fixed hinge, sealed leak |
| Clean workspace | Shows professionalism | Tidy, tools removed |
| Installed items | Documents new parts | New fixture, hardware |

### Video Guidelines

**When to take video:**
- Issue involves sound (squeak, rattle, drip)
- Issue is intermittent
- Water is flowing
- Something is moving abnormally

**Video specs:**
- 10-30 seconds
- Stable (don't shake)
- Good lighting
- Capture the sound/motion clearly

### Photo Tips

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Good lighting | Dark, blurry shots |
| Stable/in focus | Motion blur |
| Include context | Too zoomed in |
| Show the work | Miss the key detail |
| Take extras | Rely on just one |

---

## 6. Safety & Professionalism

### Personal Safety

**Before Starting Work:**
```
□ Assess the environment
□ Identify hazards (water, electrical, heights)
□ Ensure proper ventilation
□ Check for pest issues
□ Trust your instincts
```

**On the Job:**
```
□ Wear appropriate PPE
□ Use tools correctly
□ Don't take unsafe shortcuts
□ Maintain stable footing
□ Keep workspace organized
```

**Know Your Limits:**
- If it requires a license, don't do it
- If it's beyond your skills, say so
- If it feels unsafe, stop
- Electrical panel work → Electrician
- Gas work → Licensed plumber/HVAC
- Structural → Licensed contractor

### Professional Conduct

**Appearance:**
- Clean, appropriate work clothes
- Company shirt if provided
- Closed-toe shoes
- ID badge visible if required

**Communication:**
- Greet warmly and professionally
- Use customer's name
- Explain what you're doing
- Ask before using facilities
- Keep personal opinions to yourself

**Workspace:**
- Respect the home
- Remove shoes or use booties
- Lay drop cloths
- Clean as you go
- Leave better than you found it

### Customer Interaction Scripts

**Arrival:**
```
"Hi, I'm [Name] from RegularUpkeep. I'm here to help with
your [task]. Is now still a good time?"
```

**During Work:**
```
"I'm making good progress. I'll need about [X] more minutes.
Let me know if you have any questions."
```

**Completion:**
```
"All done! Let me show you what I did. [Walk through]
Everything look good to you?"
```

**If Issues Arise:**
```
"I found something unexpected: [explain]. Before I proceed,
I wanted to discuss the options with you."
```

### Emergency Situations

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Customer emergency | Call 911, then notify support |
| You're injured | Seek medical attention, report to support |
| Property damage | Document, inform customer, contact support |
| Threatening behavior | Leave safely, contact support immediately |
| Gas smell | Evacuate, call gas company, don't use electronics |
| Electrical hazard | Don't touch, turn off power if safe, call electrician |

---

## 7. Handling Changes in Scope

### When Scope Changes

**Common scenarios:**
- You discover additional damage
- Task is bigger than described
- Customer requests extra work
- Parts unavailable, alternative needed

### The Right Way to Handle It

**Step 1: Stop Work**
- Pause at the decision point
- Don't proceed with unscoped work

**Step 2: Document**
- Photo the discovery
- Note what you found

**Step 3: Communicate**
- Explain clearly to customer
- Describe options
- Get agreement before proceeding

**Step 4: Update the Platform**
- [TBD] Submit change request through app
- Wait for approval if required

### Communication Scripts

**Discovery of Additional Issue:**
```
"While working on [original task], I found [new issue].
It's not covered in the original scope. Would you like me
to address it? It would add about [time/effort]."
```

**Task Bigger Than Expected:**
```
"This is more involved than the initial description. The
original scope was [X], but it actually needs [Y]. Let me
explain the difference and we can decide how to proceed."
```

**Customer Requests Extra Work:**
```
"I can definitely do that. Since it's outside the original
scope, let me check how we handle additional work through
the app. [TBD — confirm change order process]"
```

### What NOT to Do

| Don't | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Do extra work without approval | Payment issues |
| Ignore discoveries | Customer trust |
| Promise things you can't deliver | Your reputation |
| Proceed with unsafe work | Safety and liability |
