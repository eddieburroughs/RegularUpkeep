- **Counties/Cities** - Select geographic areas

**Tip:** Start smaller and expand. It's better to have a tight service area with fast response times.

---

## 4. Getting Bookings

### 4.1 Notification Handling

When a matching job is available:

1. **Push notification** (if enabled on your device)
2. **Email notification** to your registered email
3. **In-app badge** on Jobs tab

**What You'll See:**

```
New Job Available
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Category: Plumbing
Location: Downtown (3.2 miles)
Description: Kitchen faucet leaking continuously
Urgency: This week
Customer Photos: 2 attached
Diagnostic Fee: $79

[View Details] [Accept] [Decline]
```

### 4.2 Response Time Best Practices

| Response Time | Impact |
|---------------|--------|
| Under 1 hour | Excellent - high acceptance rate |
| 1-4 hours | Good - meets Preferred tier requirement |
| 4-12 hours | Acceptable - may lose to faster providers |
| Over 12 hours | Poor - job likely assigned elsewhere |

**Response time affects:**
- Job matching priority
- Preferred tier eligibility
- Customer perception
- Your rating

### 4.3 Accept/Decline Rules of Thumb

**ACCEPT when:**
- Job is in your service area
- You have capacity to schedule within timeframe
- Category matches your expertise
- Customer photos show work you can handle
- Diagnostic fee is acceptable

**DECLINE when:**
- Outside your service area
- Fully booked for requested timeframe
- Work requires specialty you don't have
- Job seems problematic (vague description, unrealistic expectations)

**Declining is OK!** Your acceptance rate matters less than your completion quality. It's better to decline than to cancel later.

### 4.4 Reviewing Job Details

Before accepting, check:

1. **Photos/Video** - What does the issue actually look like?
2. **Description** - What does the customer think is wrong?
3. **AI Job Brief** - What's the likely scope?
4. **Location** - Is it accessible? Any special instructions?
5. **Urgency** - Can you meet their timeline?

---

## 5. Estimates & Scope of Work

### 5.1 Interpreting Homeowner Photos/Videos

**What to look for:**

| Photo Type | What It Tells You |
|------------|-------------------|
| Wide shot | Context, access, surrounding conditions |
| Close-up | Specific issue, damage extent, part identification |
| Video | Sound of problem, intermittent issues, water flow |

**Common issues with customer photos:**
- Blurry or poorly lit
- Wrong angle
- Missing context
- Outdated (issue has changed)

**When in doubt, ask for more!**

### 5.2 Asking for Missing Information

Use messaging to clarify before the diagnostic visit:

**Template: Missing Information Request**
```
Hi [Customer Name],

Thank you for your service request. Before my visit, could you help
me with a few details?

1. [Specific question about the issue]
2. [Question about access or location]
3. [Question about any previous work done]

This will help me arrive prepared with the right tools and parts.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

## 14. FAQ

### Getting Started

**Q1: How long does verification take?**
A: Typically 1-2 business days after uploading documents. Ensure documents are current and legible.

**Q2: Can I work in multiple service categories?**
A: Yes, select all categories where you're licensed and insured. You'll receive jobs matching any of your categories.

**Q3: How do I define my service area?**
A: Go to Profile → Coverage. You can set by zip codes, radius from your location, or select specific cities/counties.

**Q4: What if my insurance expires?**
A: Update your insurance certificate before it expires. If it expires, you'll be marked unverified until you upload a current certificate.

**Q5: Do I need a trade license?**
A: For regulated trades (plumbing, electrical, HVAC), yes. Handyman services may not require trade licenses depending on your state.

### Jobs & Bookings

**Q6: How am I matched with jobs?**
A: Based on your service categories, service area, availability, response time, rating, and tier status.

**Q7: What happens if I decline a job?**
A: It's offered to the next matched provider. Declining doesn't penalize you, but very low acceptance rates may affect matching.

**Q8: What's the diagnostic fee?**
A: $49-$89 depending on category. This covers your initial visit and is paid by the customer when you're dispatched.

**Q9: Is the diagnostic fee refundable?**
A: It's refundable before you accept the job. After you accept, it's non-refundable but credits toward the final invoice.

**Q10: What if I need to cancel a job I accepted?**
A: Contact the customer immediately and update the job status. Frequent cancellations hurt your metrics.

### Estimates & Pricing

**Q11: Can I charge more than my estimate?**
A: Only with an approved change order. If additional work exceeds 12% or $75 of the estimate, submit a change order.

**Q12: What's the authorization buffer?**
A: Customer's card is authorized for your estimate + 20% (max $250 buffer) to cover minor overages.

**Q13: Who sets my prices?**
A: You do. RegularUpkeep never dictates your pricing.

**Q14: Does the AI suggest prices?**
A: No. AI helps with scope, line items, and language—never pricing.

**Q15: What should my estimate include?**
A: Scope of work, line items (labor + materials), exclusions, assumptions, timeline, and warranty terms.

### Payment

**Q16: When do I get paid?**
A: Funds are available 72 hours after invoice approval, then 1-2 days to transfer to your bank.

**Q17: What's the platform commission?**
A: 8% of commissionable subtotal with a $3.50 minimum. Excludes tax, tips, and permit fees.

**Q18: How do I get instant payout?**
A: Verified tier + Instant Payout add-on (+1% per job). Enable at Billing → Add-ons.

**Q19: What if a customer doesn't approve the invoice?**
A: Invoices auto-approve after 24 hours if the customer takes no action and there's no dispute.

**Q20: What if a customer disputes?**
A: The 72-hour window allows resolution. Gather your documentation (photos, notes, estimates) and respond promptly.

### Quality & Reviews

**Q21: How is my rating calculated?**
A: Average of customer ratings on completed jobs. Maintaining 4.5+ is required for Preferred tier.

**Q22: Can I respond to reviews?**
A: [TBD — confirm review response feature in product]

**Q23: How do I improve my rating?**
A: Communicate proactively, document thoroughly, deliver quality work, and ask satisfied customers to review.

**Q24: What's the dispute rate threshold for Preferred?**
A: Must be below 5% dispute rate to maintain Preferred status.

### Account & Billing

**Q25: What's the difference between Verified and Preferred?**
